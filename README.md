This package makes it much easier to use the async-await feature of C# 4+ within Unity. After installing this package, you can 'await' objects from within async methods in the same way that you can 'yield' objects within coroutines.

This project is open source. For more info:

Note: In order for this package to work you must set your Scripting Runtime to C# 4.6. You can do this by opening your player settings (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player) and changing “Scripting Runtime Version” to “Experimental (.NET 4.6 Equivalent).
